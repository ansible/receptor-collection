# exclude_paths included in this file are parsed relative to this file's location
# and not relative to the CWD of execution. CLI arguments passed to the --exclude
# option will be parsed relative to the CWD of execution.
exclude_paths:
  - changelogs/
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside
# `.ansible-lint-ignore` (or `.config/ansible-lint-ignore.txt`) files.
# To skip a rule just enter filename and tag, like "playbook.yml package-latest"
# on a new line.
# Optionally you can add comments after the tag, prefixed by "#". We discourage
# the use of skip_list below because that will hide violations from the output.
# When putting ignores inside the ignore file, they are marked as ignored, but
# still visible, making it easier to address later.
skip_list:
  - var-naming[no-role-prefix]
